# URL Safety Check Improvements

## Overview
This update enhances the URL safety checking system to improve detection of malicious links, with a special focus on catching phishing and scam links that use domain typosquatting to impersonate popular gaming and social media platforms like Steam, Discord, and others.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Typosquatting and Phishing Domain Detection
The system now identifies suspicious domains that attempt to impersonate legitimate websites:
- Detects typosquatting attempts (e.g., "steamcommunuttly" instead of "steamcommunity")
- Identifies suspicious URLs with gift or activation paths (common in phishing attempts)
- Maintains a blocklist of known phishing domains frequently used in scams
- Analyzes URL path components for suspicious keywords like "gift", "free", "activation", etc.

### 2. Redirection Tracking
The system follows URL redirects to detect when a seemingly innocent link redirects to a malicious website. This is especially important for catching:
- Shortened URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl.com, etc.) that lead to malicious sites
- Links that use multiple redirects to hide their true destination
- Redirect chains used in phishing campaigns

### 3. Enhanced Retry Logic
The URL safety check now implements a more sophisticated retry mechanism:
- Configurable maximum retry attempts for VirusTotal analysis
- Exponential backoff between retries to avoid overwhelming external services
- Improved handling of queued statuses from the VirusTotal API
- Falls back to domain analysis when API checks are incomplete

### 4. Improved Logging
Detailed logging has been added throughout the URL checking process:
- Logs the number of URLs detected in messages
- Tracks redirect chains with clear logs of each step
- Provides detailed results for each URL checked, including detection reasons
- Summarizes safety check results for better monitoring

### 5. Conservative Handling of URL Shorteners and Suspicious Paths
The system now takes a more cautious approach with URL shorteners and suspicious paths:
- Maintains a comprehensive list of known URL shortening services
- Treats shortened URLs as suspicious if they can't be fully analyzed
- Automatically identifies URLs with suspicious path components (gift, activation, etc.)
- Provides clear information about redirect chains in notifications

## Configuration Options
New environment variables have been added to customize the URL safety check behavior:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `URL_SAFETY_MAX_RETRIES` | Maximum number of retry attempts for API calls | 3 |
| `URL_SAFETY_RETRY_DELAY` | Base delay in seconds between retries (uses exponential backoff) | 2 |
| `URL_SAFETY_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | Timeout in seconds for HTTP requests | 5.0 |
| `URL_SAFETY_THRESHOLD` | Threshold score for determining unsafe URLs (0.0-1.0) | 0.3 |
| `URL_SAFETY_IMPERSONATION_DOMAINS` | Comma-separated list of known phishing domains to block | varies |

## Example Flow

### Detecting a Phishing URL for a Gaming Platform

1. A user posts a message containing a shortened URL: `https://shorturl.at/ruo7Y`
2. The URL safety checker detects this as a shortened URL and follows the redirect
3. The system discovers that it redirects to `https://steamcommunuttly.com/gift/activation=Dor5Fhnm2w`
4. The domain impersonation checker identifies this as a typosquatting attempt of Steam ("communuttly" vs "community")
5. The system also flags the suspicious path keywords ("gift" and "activation")
6. Both the original shortened URL and the redirect target are marked as unsafe
7. The message is flagged for moderation and removed
8. Detailed logs show the full redirect chain and reasoning for the safety determination

### Detecting a Scam URL Even When API Analysis is Incomplete

1. A user posts a message with a URL that redirects to a newly created phishing site
2. The VirusTotal analysis returns "queued" status after multiple retries (common for new malicious sites)
3. Instead of marking it safe due to lack of data, the system performs additional checks:
   - Analyzes the domain for typosquatting patterns
   - Checks the URL path for suspicious keywords
   - Looks for patterns matching known scam URL structures
4. If suspicious patterns are found, the URL is marked unsafe despite incomplete API analysis
5. The specific detection reasons are included in the logging and notification

## Technical Implementation

The URL safety checker now implements:
- A sophisticated domain impersonation detection system with regex patterns for common typosquatting techniques
- A comprehensive list of popular platforms commonly targeted by phishers (Steam, Discord, Roblox, etc.)
- Path analysis to identify suspicious keywords often used in phishing URLs
- A configurable blocklist of known phishing domains
- More detailed result objects that include detection reasons and redirect information
- Better error handling for timeouts and connection issues

This update significantly improves the bot's ability to detect and block malicious links, especially those using sophisticated social engineering techniques and typosquatting domains to evade traditional detection methods.
