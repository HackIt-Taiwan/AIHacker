# Async Generator Syntax and Class Initialization Fixes

## Issue Summary

The AI Hacker Discord bot experienced critical errors that prevented it from launching:

1. An async generator method (`get_streaming_response`) in `ai_handler.py` was incorrectly attempting to return a value, which is not allowed in Python's async generators.
2. Class initialization issues with `QuestionManager` and `NotionFAQ` classes where the method signatures did not match how they were being called in `main.py`.
3. A missing function `start_moderation_queue` in the moderation queue module.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Async Generator Return Value Issue

**File:** `app/ai_handler.py`

**Problem:**
The `get_streaming_response` method was defined as an async generator (with a return type of `AsyncGenerator[str, None]`) but improperly tried to return a value at the end of the function.

**Solution:**
- Removed the return statement
- Added an instance variable to store the cleaned response instead
- Maintained full compatibility with existing code that iterates through the generated chunks

### 2. Class Initialization Parameter Issues

#### QuestionManager Class

**File:** `app/question_manager.py`

**Problem:**
The `QuestionManager` class's `__init__` method didn't accept a `bot` parameter, but it was being initialized with one in `main.py`.

**Solution:**
- Modified the `__init__` method to accept an optional `bot` parameter 
- Stored the bot instance for potential future use

#### NotionFAQ Class

**File:** `app/services/notion_faq.py`

**Problem:**
The `NotionFAQ` class's `__init__` method didn't accept API key and page ID parameters, but it was being initialized with these in `main.py`.

**Solution:**
- Modified the `__init__` method to accept optional `api_key` and `page_id` parameters
- Used provided values if available, otherwise falling back to the global configuration values

### 3. Missing Moderation Queue Function

**File:** `app/services/moderation_queue.py`

**Problem:**
The `main.py` file was trying to import and use a function named `start_moderation_queue` from the moderation queue module, but this function was not defined in the file.

**Solution:**
- Added the missing `start_moderation_queue` function that starts the global moderation queue instance
- Made the function accept an optional bot parameter to match how it's called in main.py
- Ensured the function returns the moderation queue instance for potential use

## Technical Details

### Async Generator Background

In Python, async generators:
- Are defined with `async def` and contain at least one `yield` statement
- Cannot use `return` with a value (they can only use plain `return` to exit early)
- Are designed to yield a sequence of values asynchronously
- Are typically used with `async for` loops

The original code was attempting to both yield chunks during processing and then return a final cleaned response, which is syntactically invalid.

## Prevention Recommendations

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always ensure that async generators (functions with both `async def` and `yield` statements) do not attempt to return values
2. When modifying a class's `__init__` method, verify all places where the class is instantiated
3. When adding parameters to a constructor, consider making them optional with default values to maintain backward compatibility
4. When importing functions in one module that should be defined in another, verify that those functions actually exist in the target module
